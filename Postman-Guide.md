# Beginner Guide: Setting Up Postman to Test APIs  

## Summary  

Postman is an API platform for building and testing APIs. You can use it to:  
- Send requests  
- Inspect responses  
- Automate tests  

## Who This Is For  

New developers, testers, and tech writers trying to understand or document REST APIs.  

## What You Can Do  

- Send `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests  
- Save and reuse requests in collections  
- Inspect API response status and body  

## Getting Started  

1. **Download Postman** from [https://postman.com](https://postman.com) and create an account.
